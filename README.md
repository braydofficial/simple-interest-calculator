# A very simple interest calculator
This is a very simple interest calculator, written in Python with no dependencies. You can use it, if you want to know how much money you will have after given years.
This repo won't get any updates and is just for personal purpose. However, you can use it if you want. It's not complex anyways. :D 
## How to run
Just have Python3 installed and execute the main.py with `python3 main.py`. Have fun!
